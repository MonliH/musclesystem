        Bone marrow is the spongey tissue inside your bones. One type of bone
        marrow is red marrow. Red marrow is made up of mostly hematopoietic
        tissue. In the hematopoietic tissue, a process called hematopoiesis
        occurs, in which hematopoietic stem cells form (most) of the blood cells
        in the body: red blood cells, platelets, and most white blood cells.
        This type of bone marrow can be extracted and donated to patients with
        leukemia. Leukemian is a form of cancer that affects the body{"'"}s
