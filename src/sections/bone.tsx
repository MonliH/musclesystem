        Bones are the body's main storage system of calcium and phosphorus
        inside the organism. Storage of these is important because it helps
        regulate the amount of minerals in the body’s bloodstream. When there
        are few in the bloodstream, the body withdraws some minerals from the
        bone storage; when there are many, the body stores them in the bones.

        Bone marrow is the spongey tissue inside your bones. One type of bone
        marrow is red marrow. Red marrow is made up of mostly hematopoietic
        tissue. In the hematopoietic tissue, a process called hematopoiesis
        occurs, in which hematopoietic stem cells form (most) of the blood cells
        in the body: red blood cells, platelets, and most white blood cells.
        This type of bone marrow can be extracted and donated to patients with
        leukemia. Leukemian is a form of cancer of the body’s blood forming
        tissue.
