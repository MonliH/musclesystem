        Cartilage is a flexible connective tissue that keeps joints moving by
        coating the surfaces and cushioning against impact. Cartilage is the
        main type of connective tissue and can be found throughout the body,
        including the lungs, ears, nose, spine, bones, and of course, joints.
        The attached muscles contract to move the bones.
